# Three-Panel Section Interface Design

## Layout Structure

- **Header Section**: Features a prominent title "Discover Our Authentic Pasta, Pizza and Sandwich Sauces" with a company mission statement subheading
- **Three-Column Grid Layout**: Displays product categories (Original Sauces, Organic Sauces, Ultra-Premium) with associated imagery
- **Top-down hierarchical information architecture**

## Key UI Components

- **Typography Elements**:
  - Large, bold green font for main title
  - Category subheadings (e.g., "DelGrosso Original Sauces")
  - Expandable text blocks with brand history and value propositions
- **Product Imagery**: High-resolution images of sauce jars arranged in rows within each column
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: "Order Online" buttons with arrow icons that appear on hover
- **Information Panels**: Hidden detail sections that expand on interaction

## Interactive Features

- **Hover-Triggered Expansion**: Mouse hover over product columns reveals:
  - Detailed descriptive text (brand heritage, ingredient information)
  - "Order Online" CTA buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Columns change opacity/contrast on hover to indicate interactivity
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed incrementally based on user interaction

## Color Scheme & Styling

- **Background**: Light beige/cream (neutral, warm tone)
- **Category Differentiation**:
  - Original Sauces: Deep red accent color
  - Organic Sauces: Olive green accent color
  - Ultra-Premium: Dark brown accent color
- **Text Hierarchy**: Main title in dark green, body text in black
- **CTA Buttons**: White text on colored backgrounds matching their respective categories
- **Visual Contrast**: Vibrant red sauce jars against muted background for product emphasis

## User Experience Flow

1. Initial view shows product categories with basic imagery
2. User hovers over a category column
3. Column expands to reveal detailed information
4. CTA buttons appear for conversion opportunities
5. Visual feedback guides user through exploration

This design emphasizes visual hierarchy, subtle interactivity, and progressive disclosure to guide users toward product exploration and purchase decisions.
