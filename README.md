### Wokring on the project

1.  Extending the Sanity schema

The Sanity 3 schemas for all document types are defined in the `studio/schemaTypes/documents` directory. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema as needed.

2.  Updating the front-end

The Next.JS 15 front-end is in the `web/` folder, familiarize yourself with its structure to get started.

### Deployment

#### 1. Deploying Sanity Studio

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow [`deploy-sanity.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robotostudio/turbo-start-sanity/main/.github/workflows/deploy-sanity.yml) that automatically deploys your Sanity Studio whenever changes are pushed to the `studio` directory.

> **Note**: To use the GitHub Actions workflow, make sure to configure the following secrets in your repository settings:
>
> - `SANITY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_TITLE`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_PRESENTATION_URL`
> - `SANITY_STUDIO_PRODUCTION_HOSTNAME`

Set `SANITY_STUDIO_PRODUCTION_HOSTNAME` to whatever you want your deployed Sanity Studio hostname to be. Eg. for `SANITY_STUDIO_PRODUCTION_HOSTNAME=my-cool-project` you'll get a studio URL of `https://my-cool-project.sanity.studio` (and `<my-branch-name>-my-cool-project.sanity.studio` for PR previews builds done automatically via the `deploy-sanity.yml` github CI workflow when you open a PR.)

Set `SANITY_STUDIO_PRESENTATION_URL` to your web app front-end URL (from the Vercel deployment). This URL is required for production deployments and should be:

- Set in your GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD deployments
- Set in your local environment if deploying manually with `npx sanity deploy`
- Not needed for local development, where preview will automatically use http://localhost:3000

You can then manually deploy from your Studio directory (`/studio`) using:

```shell
npx sanity deploy
```

**Note**: To use the live preview feature, your browser needs to enable third party cookies.

#### 2. Next.js app Deployment to Vercel

You have the freedom to deploy your Next.js app to your hosting provider of choice. Initially the front-end is meant to be deployed With Vercel and GitHub, from the `/apps/web` folder.

If you need to access branch previews for pull-requests, ask for access to the Vercel DelGrosso Foods Inc. org from Todd Walters at DelGrosso.

#### 3. Invite more collaborators

You can optionally invite more collaborators to the Studio: if you have access to [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select the `DelGrossoFoods.inc-25` in the `DelGrosso Foods Inc.` Org and click "Invite project members".

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.
