Add Sauces Index page with SSR + client filtering (search via Fuse.js, product line multi-select, sauce type single-select), A→Z/Z→A sorting, URL param syncing, responsive sidebar/sheet filters, and accessibility improvements. Also scaffold a basic sauce detail route at `/sauces/[slug]` as a stub for future work.
